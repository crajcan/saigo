    This file does the same as exhibit-a except it defines the shape interface as a type that has
the functions Name(), Perimeter(), and Area(). With this interface defined, we can now use any
 shape as the argument to the Efficiency() function, then calculate and print the efficiency of 
any shape using the same method.
