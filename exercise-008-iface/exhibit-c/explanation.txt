    This file implements a second instance of the Shape interface, 'Circle'. It defines the same 
three methods required of any Shape, Name(), Perimeter(), and Area(). Because it has these three 
methods, and Efficiency has been implemented to be agnostic of the Shape's type, as long as it con-
forms to the restrictions of Shape, we can use Efficiency() to operate on Circles without making
any changes to the code.
